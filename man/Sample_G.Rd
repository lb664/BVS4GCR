\usage{
Sample_G(W, GCurr, samplerPar, delta = 2)
}
\description{
Internal functions that perform one Markov chain Monte Carlo iteration to sample from the posterior distribution of a
decomposable graph. The R code of this function is a modified version of the Matlab code in \insertCite{Talhouk2012;textual}{BVS4GCR}.
